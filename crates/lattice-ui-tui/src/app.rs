//! Pure application state and transitions.
//!
//! The state machine is intentionally separated from the IO loop so it can be
//! unit-tested without spinning up a terminal. Each input keystroke becomes
//! an `Action`; `App::apply` consumes the action, dispatching motion / edit
//! work through `lattice_grammar::execute()` where appropriate.
//!
//! Phase 2 wiring: motions and the `delete` operator flow through the
//! grammar engine; the modal-mode primitives (`i`, `a`, `o`, `<Esc>`) live
//! locally on `App` because they're inherently a state-machine concern, not
//! a buffer command. Phase 3+ migrates more of these to the grammar layer.
